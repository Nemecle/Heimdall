# Heimdall, great guardian of the bots

This (personal) project aims to provide a script that control several bots (start, pause, etc) through a console while being environment-agnostic.
to achieve that, a main class "Markov_instance" should be inherited by a more specialized bot (Twitter or IRC for instance)
